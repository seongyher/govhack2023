GeoCatch is an open source suite of collaborative tools and a progressive web app with real-time predictive simulation modelling capabilities, enabling users to combat misinformation and educate the public regarding the subject of climate change. It does this through large-scale geographic simulation, data visualisation, collaborative data curation, and local-first fact-checking.
