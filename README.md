# GeoCatch

In a world grappling with the profound challenges of climate change, the enormity of rising temperatures and sea levels often leaves us feeling overwhelmed and detached from the urgent need for collective action. GeoCatch is a transformative answer to this complex dilemma, offering a dynamic solution that bridges the gap between environmental data and actionable insights.

GeoCatch, a collaborative social informatics platform, leverages authoritative datasets such as the 2021 Coastal Hazards Assessments and Sea Rise Level Data to provide real-time 3D visualizations of projected sea level rise in Christchurch's coastal area. Empowering users to manipulate emission and temperature variables, GeoCatch enables simulations of environmental impacts for varying timeframes into the future.

The platform fosters community engagement through collaborative features, including a discussion Forum, a knowledge-rich Wiki, and an Archive to catalog and counter misinformation. GeoCatch's journey forward involves integrating household emissions data and harnessing AI capabilities, ultimately propelling informed decision-making and collective action for a sustainable future.
