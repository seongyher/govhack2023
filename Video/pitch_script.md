### Scene 1
Another beautiful afternoon in Aotearoa New Zealand. It's a great day to be thinking about the future of our planet!
### Scene 2
(Person 1) I'm worried about the way that increasing temperatures will affect the sea levels, but I'm not sure how much change we can expect in 20 years. I know we're supposed to reduce emissions, but how much? It's hard to imagine the impact of any of this so far into the future...
### Scene 3
(Person 2) I think so as well. Is the temperature change really going to affect Christchurch by that much? How much difference will a few degrees Celsius make?

### Scene 4
(Person 1) If only there was a service that could accurately simulate and predict the environmental outcomes of our collective behaviour, and their impact on our city decades into the future...
### Scene 5
Good thing we literally built just that. (Show ChCh elevation map) It's called GeoCatch, a collaborative social informatics platform that provides adaptive environmental predictions for all of Otautahi Christchurch.
Utilising the Christchurch City Council's 2021 Coastal Hazards Assessments dataset and the Sea Rise Level Data from Te Tai Pari O Aotearoa (National Institute of Water and Atmosphere Research), we made a real-time 3D visualisation of the forecasted sea level rise of the Christchurch coastal area.
Users can modify the emissions and temperature values and then choose how many years into the future to project the simulation. (demo video)

### Scene 6 - Community Values
You might have noticed our cool logo. It's the initials for GeoCatch, but it's also a fish. It symbolises our common purpose or whainga, the genuine facts we "catch" amidst a sea of misinformation. All New Zealanders are aboard the he waka taurua, made up of the waka Maori and the waka Tauiwi; we aim to widen its net two halves of the connected waka.
### Scene 7 - Collaboration
GeoCatch has several collaborative features: a forum, on which users of different backgrounds can identify and discuss emerging misinformation trends, in order to efficiently counter their cascading effects. On the GeoCatch Wiki, users can collaboratively develop a knowledge base of educational resources, data sources, tools, and guides for learning more about environmental issues. On the GeoCatch Archive, users can collaborate with local experts to track, trawl, and tag disinfo in order to build a database of misleading information and harmful narratives; rich data such as this can be used to train machine learning models to better detect misinformation in the wild, especially when trained in parallel on highly accurate data provided by reliable sources.
### Scene 8 - Future tech
Our next step will be to incorporate household emissions data from the Greater Christchurch Partnership, in order to provide real-time projections based on the data. After that, we'll make full use of the abundant open data by employing machine learning and AI capabilities: (the three future features slides)
